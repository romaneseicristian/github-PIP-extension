Privacy Policy for SoundCloud PiP Extension
This Privacy Policy describes how the "SoundCloud PiP" Chrome extension (the "Extension") handles your data. The Extension is designed to provide Picture-in-Picture functionality for SoundCloud, and it operates with your privacy as a top priority.

1. Data Collection

The SoundCloud PiP Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) or user data. We do not have access to your browsing history, account information, or any other private data.

2. Data Use and Local Processing

The Extension operates entirely on your local device. It requires access to the following public information on the active soundcloud.com tab to function:

Track Title and Artist: To display the current track's name in the Picture-in-Picture window.

Artwork URL: To fetch the track's album art and display it in the PiP window.

Playback State: To determine whether the track is playing or paused, allowing the extension to control it.

Playback Buttons: To interact with the play/pause, next, and previous buttons on the SoundCloud page.

This information is processed exclusively on your device and is used for the sole purpose of enabling and controlling the Picture-in-Picture video stream. No data is sent to a remote server or shared with any third party.

3. Data Retention and Deletion

All data processed by the Extension is temporary and non-persistent. Once the Picture-in-Picture window is closed or the SoundCloud tab is navigated away from, all data related to the session is immediately discarded and not retained.

4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
